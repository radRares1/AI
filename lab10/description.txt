I chose the furnace problem and I'm using the mamdami model with the largest of maximum defuzzification.

The two examples are set as: 1) cold(22) and small(2) yeild small(0.6)
			     2) cool(50) and medium(6) yield medium(0.5)

- in the temperature and in the capacity files I keep the points from the graphs in dictionaries with
the label as key and a list of touples of (X,Y) points from the graph representing the areas of each label

- the rules table is kept as a dictionary
- in the fuz file is where the calculations are
